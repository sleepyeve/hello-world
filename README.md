Hi Humans!

I hope nobody is offended at being called human. If you are, I deeply appologize. I wish I could get along with everyone, but it sometimes seems impossible. I like being alone, eating alone, reading alone and listening to music alone. But sometimes I am painfully aware why I don't fancy being lonely.
